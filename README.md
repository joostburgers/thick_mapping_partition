### Abstract
The 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan was the largest forced displacement of people in the twentieth century. The scale and impact of the event has engendered different research approaches across disciplines. Although scholarship in Partition Studies is very varied, the field can be divided into two predominant methodologies: quantitative sociological descriptions and qualitative narrative accounts. This study attempts to bridge these two methodologies by “thick mapping” the accounts of people’s Partition experiences that publicly available through the 1947 Partition Archive. This medium-scale investigation deploys Natural Language Processing and geoparsing techniques to analyse 321 narrative accounts of 112 women and 209 men who migrated to Delhi in the immediate aftermath of Partition. Broadly speaking, we wanted to know how people narrated their experience of Partition, and what variables informed the places they represented in their accounts. The data suggests that gender and occupation influenced how the interviewees mapped out their lives after Partition. The provisional results indicate that men were more likely to speak about their occupation, and draw upon a more extensive geography to position themselves in relation to the narrative. This hints at a narrative strategy that tries to put Partition “behind” and “away”; a technique that would have been less available to women. Due to the limited scope of the data, this is highly speculative. Therefore, this study should be seen as a pilot project for a more robust undertaking when more data becomes available through the 1947 Archive.
